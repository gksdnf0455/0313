    <h1>Yamaha Corporation</h1>

    <h3>History</h3>
    <p>
        Nippon Gakki Co. Ltd. (currently Yamaha Corporation) was established in 1887 as <br>
        a reed organ manufacturer by Torakusu Yamaha (山葉寅楠) in Hamamatsu, Shizuoka Prefecture and was<br> 
        incorporated on 12 October 1897. In 1900, the company started the production of <br>
        pianos. The first piano to be made in Japan was an upright built in 1900 by Torakusu Yamaha, founder of Nippon Gakki Co., Ltd. — later renamed Yamaha Corporation.[2]<br>
        The company's origins as a musical instrument manufacturer are still reflected today in the group's logo—a trio of interlocking tuning forks.[3][2]

        After World War II, company president Genichi Kawakami repurposed the <br>
        remains of the company's war-time production machinery and the company's<br>
        expertise in metallurgical technologies to the manufacture of motorcycles. The YA-1 (AKA Akatombo, the "Red Dragonfly"),<br> 
        of which 125 were built in the first year of production (1954), was named in honour of the founder. It was a 125cc, single cylinder,<br>
        two-stroke street bike patterned after the German DKW RT 125 (which the British munitions firm, BSA, had also copied in the post-war era and <br>
        manufactured as the Bantam and Harley-Davidson as the Hummer). In 1955,[4] the success of the YA-1 <br>
        resulted in the founding of Yamaha Motor Co., Ltd., splitting the motorcycle division from the<br> 
        company. Also, in 1954 the Yamaha Music School was founded.[2]
